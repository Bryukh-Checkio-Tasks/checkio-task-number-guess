<p>
    Given an unknown number, range from 1 to 100, and your task is, <strong>guess the number by doing series of attempts</strong>.<br><br>
    Your solution will guess the number by submitting an <strong>integer divisor</strong>, range from 2 to 10, and your best <strong>guess number</strong>.
    At each attempt, you will get information, as a list of tuples, whose each tuple contains its remainder result, and your previous divisor. <br><br>
    You should find the number in 8 guesses.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Information about previous attempt. A list of tuples. Each tuple contains its remainder and previous divisor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list of integer divisor and your best guess. A list of two integers.

    <pre class="brush: python">checkio([(1,5)])                # the number has a remainder 1
checkio([(1,5),(2,3)])          # the number has a remainder 2
checkio([(1,5),(2,3),(3,4)])    # the number has a remainder 3
checkio([(1,5),(2,3),(3,4),(3,8)])    # the number has a remainder 3</pre>
